<p>
If you do the following SQL query in MySQL
</p>
<code>
SELECT * FROM `mizar_symbols` WHERE name='Ball'
</code><p>
Then Records with names equal 'ball' or 'BALL' or 'bALl',etc will return at the same time. Generally, the collation setting is the one to blame. As a workaround, you should type the following</p>
<code>
SELECT * FROM `mizar_symbols` WHERE name=binary 'Ball'
</code><p>
And the following is a SQL that checks for duplication with case sensitiveness in concern.</p>
<code>
SELECT DISTINCT (
binary name
) AS name, COUNT( name ) AS count
FROM  `mizar_symbols` 
GROUP BY binary name
HAVING count >1
</code>

<p>Changing the collation type also saves the day</p>
<code>
ALTER TABLE  `mizar_symbols` CHANGE  `name`  `name` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL
</code>
