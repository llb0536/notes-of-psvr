<p>The speed at which Matlab Compiler updates its knowledge of known compilers will never be sufficiently fast. For example, now that I'm using Matlab 7.10.0(R2010a), and I'm trying to setup the mbuild utility of it. I opened the Windows Command Prompt, typed "mbuild -setup" and let it search for compilers. Having already installed Visual Studio 2010, mbuild failed to find it.</p>
<p>In fact, up to this version of matlab, it only recognizes Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2005. In order to use the 2010 version, here is a simple work-around.</p>
<p>When being asked</p>
<blockquote>
Would you like mbuild to locate installed compilers [y]/n?
</blockquote>
<p>Answer n and</p>
<blockquote>
Would you like mbuild to locate installed compilers [y]/n? n<br />
<br />
Select a compiler:<br />
[1] Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1<br />
[2] Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express<br />
[3] Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1<br />
<br />
[0] None<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Answer 3 (We want to rely on the most probable backward compatibility of Microsoft)</p>
<blockquote>
The default location for Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 compilers is C:\Program F
iles (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0,<br />
but that directory does not exist on this machine.<br />
<br />
Use C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0 anyway [y]/n?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Answer n and next step will ask you for alternative path, enter the real path to later version of visual studios. For example, </p>
<code>
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0
</code>
<p>In fact, the last output makes a nice hint that you can instead directly edit the following file in order to obtain more fine-tuned settings</p>
<code>
C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2010a\compopts.bat
</code>
