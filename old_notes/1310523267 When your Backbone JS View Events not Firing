<p>I've been using <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone.js</a> to develop some javascript-heavy application recently.</p>

<p>I find it quite common for new comers to come into the following problem: why ain't my view events firing?</p>

<p>By "view events" I mean a events hash like the following in a Backbone View class declaration.</p>
<code>
<pre>
class Mine.Views.TasksNew extends Backbone.View
  events:
    "click #preview_button":"parse"
    
  constructor:(options)->
    super(options)
    
  parse:(e)->
    alert 'clicked'

  ...
</pre>
</code>

<p>When your events are not firing, the following is a useful checklist to go through.</p>


<p>1.Maybe you have in the previous class declaration something like "el:\$('#myelement')" and expecting the View to be bound to that specific element. But be cautious! The class declaration may be executed before the page is fully loaded. (This is common since I have seen most people put the class declaration before everything else). Please try to move "el:\$('#myelement')" to the spot where you instantiate the View class and maybe the problem could be solved.</p>
<p>2.Maybe your "el" is too restrictive. You should be know that the objects mentioned in the events hash are restricted inside the el element.</p>
<p>3.Be aware of the order inside `"click #preview_button":"parse"`! It's `event` followed by `selector` followed by `handler`. Did you reversed the order?</p>
<p>4.Trace down the code using firebug,etc. The code of backbone.js is well readable.</p>

<p>This checklist incorporated the bad things that has happened to me that makes my events not firing. Hope it helps you!</p>
