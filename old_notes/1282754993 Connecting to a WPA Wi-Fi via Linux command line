<p>I'm currently using Debian 5.0 with my laptop and I spend a lot of time working on command line without starting x. It toke me quite a lot of time to figure this out how to connect wirelessly to a WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK encrypted Wi-Fi spot. However, the answer turns out to be quite simple.</p>

<p>You need the package "wireless-tools" and "wpasupplicant". If you don't have them, apt-get'em first. Then</p>

<code>
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
</code>

Add the following lines

<code>
auto wlan0<br />
iface wlan0 inet dhcp<br />
wpa-ssid [YOURNETWORKNAME]<br />
wpa-psk [YOURPASSWORD]
</code>

<p>where the brackets should be replaced by appropriate content. Then save and exit, and</p>

<code>
ifup wlan0
</code>

<p>Then everything starts working smoothly. It also works for ubuntu server (10.04 tested)</p>
