Say you wanna get the current script name or script path in a bash script, say, ~/.bashrc, you probably want to do it like this:
</p>

<code>
echo Hello from $0
</code>

<p>However you will find out that it does not work since all that it outputs is: </P>
<blockquote>
bash
</blockquote>

<p>See? It's only the name of the script via which the system calls the script. To get the real path, try this</p>

<code>
echo ${BASH_SOURCE[*]}
</code>

<p>Then a whole chain of paths got output, which includes all the real paths of the scripts that has been called upon the execution point of the current script.</p>
<p>In fact, bash has more built-in arrays like BASH_SOURCE, just <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Variables.html">check this out</a>.</p>
